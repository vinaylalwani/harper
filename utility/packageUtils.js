/**
 * A naive find-up implementation to find the root package.json, and
 * subsequently the root directory of the package. In theory we could require
 * package.json directly (`require('../../package.json')`), but that would not
 * give us the root directory of the repo, which is needed for other things.
 * Furthermore, when this is eventually converted to TS, we should consider
 * using `import('../../package.json')` as that will give type-safe access to
 * the package.json file.
 *
 * The purpose of doing this instead of cobbling together a path directly is
 * that in development mode this file will be resolved from its actual path
 * `/utility/packageUtils.js`, but in production, it will be bundled into the
 * built output and the path will be different. Since builds will not
 * automatically transform a path like that (it will only do so for
 * requires/imports), we need to stick to directory traversal to find the
 * package root.
 *
 * This function isn't full-proof and could fail in some edge cases. The max
 * iteration check is in place to prevent infinite loops.
 *
 * If we ever encounter this error, we should improve the function to handle
 * the edge case instead of just increasing the `MAX` value.
 *
 * @returns {string} package.json file path
